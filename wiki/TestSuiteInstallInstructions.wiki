==Install==
You must have the Steam version of Torchlight (v1.15). If you obtained Torchlight through other publishers this will unfortunately not work:

Download the TestSuite from: http://code.google.com/p/tlapi/downloads/list
Extract the files into your Steam Torchlight folder:
  * i.e.: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\torchlight

Start Torchlight.

The TestSuite will be run automatically.


==Uninstall==
Remove the following files/folders from your Torchlight directory:
  * winmm.dll
  * TLAPI/IngameTest0.layout
  * TLAPI/IngameTest0.layout

Note: The install contains a resources.cfg file that you should not remove, if you wish to revert it, remove the last line present dealing with TLAPI.

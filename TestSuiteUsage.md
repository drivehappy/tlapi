### Running the TestSuite ###
Once the TestSuite is installed and Torchlight is running you will see a console window that dumps some information of the game as it progresses. Additionally, a log file is kept that tracks other information of the game under the Torchlight directory called testLog.txt.

Load or create a game. A button labeled with "Open Tests" will be available. If you click it the test window will appear with the available tests.

### Testing ###
Essentially, all of these tests should work as stated without causing crashes or unexpected behavior. If the game does crash, please send an email to: drivehappy at gmail.com describing what you did, your testLog.txt and the saved game if possible so that it may be fixed.

### Known Issues ###
A resolution change in-game will hide the Test UI. Restart the game to fix.
